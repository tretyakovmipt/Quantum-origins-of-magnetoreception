Theory work and supporting numerical simulations for my postdoctoral project at UCLA. It invetigates the magnetic field effect on the radical pair mechanism a toy-model Hamiltonian. The project summary report is in A_closer_look_at_the_unitary_evolution_in_the_radical_pair_mechanism.pdf (Eventually, I hope to publish it).
