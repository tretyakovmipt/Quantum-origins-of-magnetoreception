Theory work and supporting numerical simulations for my postdoctoral project at UCLA. It investigates the magnetic field effect on the radical pair mechanism a toy-model Hamiltonian. 

The project summary report is in A_closer_look_at_the_unitary_evolution_in_the_radical_pair_mechanism.pdf (Eventually, I hope to publish it).

Field.ipynb contains simulations in the case of the semi-classical nuclear field for the hyperfine coupling.
The simulations include
  * populations time evolution with no recombination in the DC case
  * populations and yields time evolution with recombination in both DC and RF cases
  * angular dependence of the steady-state yields in both DC and RF cases
  * RF resonance
